I work with automation of analyses and interpretation of DNA sequencing data, focusing on pipelines for identifying and classifying variants relevant to genetic diagnostics in humans. I use Python, Go, SQL, and cloud and CI/CD tools (Google Cloud, CircleCI) to develop and scale efficient solutions. In my daily work, I apply clean code best practices, maintain processes in legacy systems, and collaborate on research projects focused on agricultural pathogens and human genomes.
